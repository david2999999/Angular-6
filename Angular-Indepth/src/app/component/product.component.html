<!--The square brackets (the [ and ] characters) tell Angular that this is a one-way data binding that has an
expression that should be evaluated. Angular will still process the binding if you omit the brackets and the
target is a directive, but the expression wonâ€™t be evaluated, and the content between the quote characters
will be passed to the directive as a literal value.-->
