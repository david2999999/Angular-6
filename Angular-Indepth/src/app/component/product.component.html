<!-- The new binding in this example specifies that the value property should be bound to the result of an
expression that calls a method on the data model to retrieve a data object from the repository by specifying
a key. It is possible that there is no data object with that key, in which case the repository method will
return null.
To guard against using null for the host elementâ€™s value property, the binding uses the template null
conditional operator (the ? character) to safely navigate the result returned by the method -->
