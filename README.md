## Angular 6
Angular taps into some of the best aspects of server-side development and uses them to enhance HTML
in the browser, creating a foundation that makes building rich applications simpler and easier. Angular
applications are built around a design pattern called Model-View-Controller (MVC), which places an
emphasis on creating applications that are
* Extendable: It is easy to figure out how even a complex Angular app works once you
understand the basicsâ€”and that means you can easily enhance applications to
create new and useful features for your users.
* Maintainable: Angular apps are easy to debug and fix, which means that long-term
maintenance is simplified.
* Testable: Angular has good support for unit and end-to-end testing, meaning that
you can find and fix defects before your users do.
* Standardized: Angular builds on the innate capabilities of the web browser without
getting in your way, allowing you to create standards-compliant web apps that
take advantage of the latest features (such as HTML5 APIs) and popular tools and
frameworks.
